sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort is the fastest in sorting the already sorted text. And is also the slowest in the reversed text.
It matches with the data that I have written that's why I assume that sort1 uses Bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Even though Merge sort is not the fastest in sorting the already sorted text, it is still better than bubble sort.
It is because Merge sort is very fast in sorting no matter if it is sorted,random, or reversed. By observing the data that I have collected,
I can see that sort2 is consistently fast in sorting sorted,random, and reversed text. That is why I assume that sor2 uses Merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Selection sort is an algorithm that gets slower the bigger the number it sorts. It matches with the data
that I have collected, that's why I assume that sort3 uses Selection sort.
